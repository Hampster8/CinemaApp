# Cinema App using React, Express & MongoDB

We are five students at HÃ¶gskolan Kristianstad who decided upon creating a Cinema App for educational purposes.

### Prerequisites

Install the dependencies using `npm install` and then create a **.env** file in the root folder.

These parameters are mandatory in the **.env** file.

| Parameters            | Description                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| MONGODB_DATABASE_URL  | Connection string to your MongoDB                 |
| MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME | Name of the Database in MongoDB                   |
| HASH_SECRET           | Random string used for hasing, (your secret)      |
| JWT_SECRET            | Random string used for jwt, (your secret)         |
| ADMIN_SECRET          | Random string used for admin token, (your secret) |
| OMDBAPI               | API key from OMDBAPI                              |
| USE_DUMMY_DATA        | Populate with dummy data                          |

&nbsp;

###### Example of how the file would look like:

```
MONGODB_DATABASE_URL = mongodb://username:password@host:port/database?options...
MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME = myDatabase
HASH_SECRET = asecretyoudefines
JWT_SECRET = asecretyoudefines
ADMIN_SECRET = asecretyoudefines
OMDBAPI = secretfromOMDBAPI
USE_DUMMY_DATA = false
```

### How to start the app and its Package.json Scripts

Run the application in production mode: `npm run start`

| Scripts          | Description                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| npm install      | Installs dependencies           |
| npm run frontend | Runs the frontend in dev mode   |
| npm run backend  | Runs the backend                |
| npm run build    | Builds the frontend             |
| npm run start    | Builds and runs the application |

&nbsp;

### API routes

Majority of routes requires admin access, to get admin access you need to have an bearer token wich is the same as the .env ADMIN_SECRET
